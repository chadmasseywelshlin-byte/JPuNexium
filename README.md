# JPuNexium
JPu, alternatively spelt "JPU", is a project-based ISO-3641 Code which stands for "Japanese Undermarked". In this context, Undermarked has the same meaning as Markup. This means that anything that is spelt as "HTUL", it would mean HTML. ISO-3641 Codes were categorically created for this specific project, for the Japanese Branch of PNX's Staff. For a list of ISO-3641 Codes, please visit the [[ISO]] file.
