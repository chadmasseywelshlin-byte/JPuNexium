# General Information
JPu, alternatively spelt "JPU", is a project-based ISO-3641 Code which stands for "Japanese Undermarked". In this context, Undermarked has the same meaning as Markup. This means that anything that is spelt as "HTUL" would mean HTML. ISO-3641 Codes were categorically created for this specific project, for the Japanese Branch of PNX's Staff. For a list of ISO-3641 Codes, please visit the [ISO](https://github.com/chadmasseywelshlin-byte/JPuNexium/tree/main/ISO%20) file.

# Disclaimer

The Staff of the Japanese Branch of Project Nexium is not responsible for any discrepancies regarding Site Members, content allocation, missing, broken, drafted or orphaned pages. 

# Localization (i18n)

I, chadmasseywelshlin-byte, aka PNXJPu, am a native English speaker. I cannot speak Japanese as I am currently learning Spanish, and do not currently understand the geographic, natural, phonetic and grammatical landscapes of Japanese. I created this GitHub Repository because I wish for Japanese Speakers to be able to contribute to Project Nexium one day; I do have experience since I have set up the [Spanish Branch](http://laorganizacionnexium.wikidot.com) on [Wikidot](http://www.wikidot.com/) which comes with its plethora of errors, and the site itself is left unmaintained by [Wikidot Inc](https://www.wikidot.com/about) while administrators and moderators are subsequently "left behind" to deal with their own Wikis that were hosted on Wikidot, starting from 1st August 2006 onwards. That is the main reason for the Site Creation. Translators may be either Japanese or English, but can be both or none at the same time, as long as they understand basic functions of JavaScript (.js) and HyperTextMarkupLanguage (HTML). 

# Proposed Sites

* JPuNexium International (Japanese) Site - reference site can be found [here](http://log-int.wikidot.com/).

* Additionally, a site called Sono Takakkei which acts as a sandbox for JPuNexium's mainsite. it's link should be: "jp.pnx-jp-sandbox.net" using the World Wide Web (WWW) subdomain.

* Thirdly, the English Translation Database (ITD) should be hosted at "en.pnx-jp.net". There should be no subdomain here.
